#### statics.json structure

The three root arrays are mandatory, when displayed, object's order is kept.

Here is how the object is structured:

    {
        "tutorials": [                         // Mandatory
            {                                  // This object represents a folder inside the tutorials folder 
              "title": "title displayed",      // The title displayed in the list of folders 
              "name": "foldername",            // The folder name with no spaces, no special chars except underscores
              "img": "img/tutorials/name.jpg", // Place your image inside the public/img/tutorials/
              "desc": "my great tutos serie",  // This is the description of the folder, don't make it too long :)
              "files": [                       // This is the list of files inside your folder
                {
                    "title":'tuto title',      // The title displayed in the list of tutorials 
                    "filename":'tuto title',   // The file name with no spaces, no special chars except underscores, and no extension
                    "hidden" : true            // Should this file be hidden in the global list ? false by default
                },
                ...
              ]
            },
            ...
        ],
        "exporters": [],                       // Mandatory
        "extensions": []                       // Mandatory
    }

### Build documentation for your own version of BabylonJs

This can be done very easily by following these steps:

1. Get a local copy of the documentation
2. Head to scripts\helpers\builder\sources
3. Add your typescript description file in the current folder
4. Make sure your file name is like 'babylon.<version>.d.ts'
5. Head to scripts\helpers\builder
6. Open the config.js file
7. Change the ```version``` and the ```previousVersion``` properties
8. Head to content\classes
9. Make sure there is no folder named like the version you want to build
10. Open your command shell and run ```npm run build```
10. Rebuild the doc: ```grunt build```

### How to structure your document to get a functional Table Of Content (TOC)

A TOC is automatically generated on the compilation of the general, tutorials, exporters and extensions md files into HTML.
In order to get a functional TOC, you need to follow two very simple rules:
    * every markdown lines beginning by a series "#" will be included in the TOC
    * DO NOT put a link inside of your heading

If you do put a link, like this:

	## [](https://awesomewebsite.com/somethingInteresting.html)Animations

... or like this:

    ## [Animations](https://awesomewebsite.com/somethingEvenMoreInteresting.html)

... it will be included in the TOC, but **won't be clickable** (meaning, user's browser won't jump to the selected content)

Also, the TOC is automatically nested. It means that if you write something like this:

	# Main title
    <insert content here>
    ## Secondary title 1
    <insert content here>
    ### Third title
    <insert content here>
    ## Secondary title 2
    <insert content here>
    ## Secondary title 3
    <insert content here> 

You will get the following TOC:

	1. Main title
		1. Secondary title 1
			1. Third title
		2. Secondary title 2
		3. Secondary title 3

    
NB: For safety, you need to delete yourself the version of classes in content\classes in order to rebuild the same version.
