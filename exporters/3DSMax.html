You just have to unzip the content of the archive to [3ds max folder\bin\assemblies]</p>
<p><strong>After unzipping DLLs, you may have to go through all files, right-click on them, select the Properties menu and click on Unblock button to remove security protection enforce by Windows</strong></p>
<p>If you right click on the scene, on a light, on a camera or on a mesh you fill have a [Babylon...] menu.</p>

<h2><a name="animations" class="anchor" href="#animations"></a>Animations</h2><p>Cameras, lights and meshes have custom properties (Right-click and select &quot;Babylon properties&quot; menu) to automatically launch animations at startup.</p>
<p>Animations are exported by sampling keyframes which can generate a lot of data. To reduce file size, you can opt to use linear interpolation instead of bezier or TCB.</p>
<h2><a name="consideration-about-bones" class="anchor" href="#consideration-about-bones"></a>Consideration about bones</h2><p>To ensure that bones are correctly exported, you have to use the Skin modifier. Skin should be positioned at origin.</p>
<h2><a name="using-actions-builder" class="anchor" href="#using-actions-builder"></a>Using Actions Builder</h2><p>Vresion 2.2.0 introduced a new feature called Actions Builder. This tool allows you to visually design your actions. <a href="https://medium.com/babylon-js/actions-builder-b05e72aa541a">More info here</a></p>
