Since Babylon and Blender often do things differently, it can sometimes be a pain working with both of them together. Here's a few tips that will smooth things out a bit.

##Quickly Export

If you go to file>export and right click on babylon, you can select "Create Shortcut", and make a easy to use shortcut to export to babylon! I personally use Ctrl-E


##Maximum # of influencers fix

If you ever get the error "WARNING: Maximum # of influencers exceeded for a vertex, extras ignored", never fear! In weight painting mode, click "weights" and then "limit total". This will automatically limit the mesh's vertices to 4 influences!!
