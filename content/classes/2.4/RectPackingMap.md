## Description

class [RectPackingMap](/classes/2.4/RectPackingMap) extends [PackedRect](/classes/2.4/PackedRect)

The purpose of this class is to pack several Rectangles into a big map, while trying to fit everything as optimally as possible.

This class is typically used to build lightmaps, sprite map or to pack several little textures into a big one.

Note that this class allows allocated Rectangles to be freed: that is the map is dynamically maintained so you can add/remove rectangle based on their life-cycle.
