## Babylon Playground ##

The BabylonJS Playground is an on-line white-boarding and experimenting application to assist in creating scenes for the Javascript-based BabylonJS webGL framework.  

## An Example Playground ##

You might want to open the playground example below in a new window or new tab, so you can switch back and forth between here and there.

[Playground Example](http://babylonjs-playground.com/#QKQHS)

See the 'createScene' function in the left-side code editing window?  Does it look familiar?  It is the very same code from the purple section of the big picture (but with a couple of word-wrapped lines).  Now you can see why the createScene function is an important section.  It is somewhat portable.  You can copy createScene functions to/from the playground editor, and to/from your home scene files.

Suppose you have been working on a BabylonJS project at home, and after many tries, you just cannot get it to work properly.  You could copy your home createScene function, then visit the playground, press its **CLEAR** button to empty its editor window, and then paste YOUR createScene function into the editor. Press the playground's **RUN** button and see if it works.  If it does not work, you can do some changes in the editor window, and hit **RUN** again... and again, and again.  Experiment with it there, and if you still cannot get it to work, you can press the **SAVE** button.  When you do that, the playground will give your scene a unique URL.  It will look something like this:

'''
http://babylonjs-playground.com/#QKQHS
'''

Now you can bookmark that unique URL, and then visit the Babylon.js forum at:

http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/16-babylonjs/

There, you can start a new topic, tell everyone the URL to your broken playground createScene function, and ask others if they will please visit your playground scene and help you get it working correctly.  

This is called white-boarding.  It is an easy way to allow many people to work on your createScene function and help you figure out what is wrong.  See how the createScene function is 'portable'?  You took it from your home, to the playground, then played with it there for awhile.  Then, if needed, you clicked the playground's **SAVE** button, which gave it a URL.   Then you went to the forum and showed that URL to others, and asked for their help.  Handy, huh?  We think so.

## More About The Playground ##
Once again let's visit the saved playground scene that I sent you to, above.

http://babylonjs-playground.com/#QKQHS

This time, I would like you to press the **Get .zip** button.  The playground will open a small panel allowing you to download this scene.  Save the zip file in some new empty folder on your home computer.  Now use an UNZIP utility program to unzip it.  Notice that there is one file in the folder, called index.html.  Please load that file into a text editor or programming editor.  Does it look like the big picture above?  Sure it does.  ANY scene from the Babylon.js playground, including its pre-installed demo scenes, can be brought to your home with the **Get .zip** button.  Most of them will look very similar to the big picture, above.


Wow, this is a lot of information, isn't it?  You have learned what a scene file (the big picture) looks like, you have learned about its important createScene() function and how copy'n'paste portable it is.  You have seen a createScene() function in the Babylon.js playground, and you have been introduced to the playground's RUN, SAVE, and Get .zip buttons.

You are becoming a Babylon.js TOOLS expert.  When I say 'tools', I mean... you have learned the things that SUPPORT the createScene() function.  Are you ready to engage in learning some things about the code that is used in a createScene() function?  I knew you were.

## Diving into createScene() ##
 
I would like you to visit the Babylon.js Playground once again (open in a new window or new tab, if possible), but this time we will visit its base URL at:

http://babylonjs-playground.com

Notice the button that is currently labeled **Basic Scene**.  (It is actually called the Scene Selector button, but it is currently LABELED 'Basic Scene')

Click on it, please.  Notice that there is a wide variety of pre-installed scenes (createScene functions).  Feel free to select any of them.  Tour them, drag your pointer around on them, and even change the code in the editor and hit **RUN** again.  You cannot damage the pre-installed scenes, even if you hit **SAVE**.  You are safe in a playground of Babylon.js scenes, and you can see MANY createScene functions in action.  You can play with their settings and hit Run again - fun.  And again, you can use the **Get .zip** button on any of these playground demos, and take copies of them for your home collection.  Handy, yes?

Now for the good stuff.  

You can learn many more things about Babylon.js scenes in parts of the guide and don't forget to look at the 'createScene()' functions of the playground's pre-installed demo scenes.  The Babylon.js playground is a learning wonderland, and it is a whole lot of fun, too.
